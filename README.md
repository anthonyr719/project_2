# Event Favoriter

The Event Favoriter app allows user to search for local events and add their favorite events to their profile list. The user must login to create their list, but once they start to build a favorites list they will be able to stay up to date with exciting and interesting events. Each event that is sent to the profile "Favorites" list also displays a text box for users to include notes or reminders for each event.
